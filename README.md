Python Web App

For this project, I used Shadid Haque's "Using GraphQL with Python" guide. 

The main issue I ran into with this project was outdated code snippets. This guide was published in May 11, 2021, and there were a few small gramatical errors and some outdated imports. 
Once past these samll issues, the guide was very helpfel in setting up these libraries. 

I learned about setting up a Flask server with Python, and connecting this to a Postgres database. Finally, I used Graphql to Query the server, as well as perform mutations. I ended up
using Neon to host the database because ElaphanSQL was shutting down its servers, and this would allow me to more easily re-visit this project in the future. I purposfully used a lot of
comments for this project to help my self break down the different parts and understand how they work. This will also allow me to use this project as a reference for future projects. 

Moving forward from this project, I'd like to start from scratch and apply what i've learned to a larger scale program. This would entail more queries and mutations, as well as a 
functioning user interface.
